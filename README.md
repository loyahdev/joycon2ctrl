# joycon2ctrl
A experimental tool to allow compatibility with Nintendo Switch 2 Joycon 2's for MacOS.

This is a fork and modified project from [joycon2mouse](https://github.com/moutella/joycon2mouse) and all original code is accredited to them.


## Current Implementation
So far this project is able to read most of the data from the Joycon 2's and convert it to work
on the mouse and keyboard.

- WASD = Joystick L
- Arrow Keys = DPAD L
- TFGH = Joystick R
- IJKL = X Y B A Resepectively
- 1 = ZL
- 2 = L
- 9 = R
- 10 = ZR

> [!WARNING]
> The reason I haven't added native HID emulation to make these work as controller is because I am yet to get a response from Apples Developer Team with the nessecary entitlements I need.
