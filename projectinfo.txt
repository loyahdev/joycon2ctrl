This project is a research service for the recently released Nintendo Switch 2 console.
I'm trying to make a Nintendo Switch 2 Joy Con 2 or pair of them to work fully on MacOS.

Back when the original Nintendo Switch came out it took Apple 4 years before they added
native support. I am trying to create my own support and have these Joy Con 2's act as a normal
controller on MacOS without waiting years for Apple to do it.

This project is made in Python and is run using py2app for simplicity as a sole menu bar app on macOS.

The current state of this project is that the controllers connect perfectly fine. I have mouse support as well
since the Joycon 2's have a mouse sensor on the bottom and it works on MacOS as normal. I also have all button presses
being printed to the console as well and that works as well.

The current issue is getting these Joycon 2 controllers to work as a normal bluetooth HID device on MacOS.
This is proving difficult as these controllers use BLE technology and since MacOS doesn't support them they
don't show up as a bluetooth controller in MacOS. Again my current state is I have logging for all button presses.

For this project leave mouse mode and that aside.

Most useful code is in joycon.py, main.py, and player.py with the rest of the code being around places.
